# GAMO: Generative Adversarial Minority Oversampling

The following is an implementation of a deep oversampling approach for classification in presence of class imbalance in image dataset. The algorithm can be described as a game between three players, where a classifier performs its usual actions, a generator attempts to create convex combination of points inside a class which are likely to be misclassified by the classifier, and a discriminator which enforces the generator to adhere the class distribution.

## Data and code files
The GAMO framework can be used on pre-computed feature vectors or flattened image. Additionally, GAMO can extract useful convolutional features from images by itself. To illustrate both of these features we have provided the codes in this repository, where MNIST (flattened image is taken as features) and Fashion-MNIST (convolutional features are extracted guided by the classifier) is used
codes and datasets from MNIST , and Fashion-MNIST . Both of our datasets have an imbalance ratio of 100, which are created by sampling from the respective training sets.

### Dependencies:
You can use either **python2.7 (and above) or python3** as per your choice.
Additionally you will need **keras (with any backend), scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, os, sys, opencv, pickle, matplotlib** as supporting libraries.

Data preparation:
Download and format the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST dataset in csv.
You can use **MNIST_fMNIST_process.py** to create datasets which are similar to ours.
